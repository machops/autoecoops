# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to deploy the frontend application (`frontend/project-01`) to Cloudflare Pages using the OpenNext Cloudflare adapter.

## Build Configuration

The build configuration is managed in two places:

### 1. Repository Configuration (`wrangler.toml`)

Located at the repository root, this file contains the build settings used by Cloudflare Pages:

```toml
# Cloudflare Pages build configuration
[build]
pages_build_output_dir = "frontend/project-01/.open-next/assets"
command = "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm --filter \"./frontend/project-01...\" run build:cf"
cwd = "."
watch_paths = ["frontend/project-01/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,css}"]
```

**Key Points:**
- `pages_build_output_dir`: Points to the exact location where OpenNext generates the Cloudflare-compatible build output
- `command`: Uses pnpm filter with **path-based selection** (`./frontend/project-01...`) instead of package name
- Path-based filtering ensures the build won't break if the package name changes (e.g., from `autoecoops-frontend` to `machops-frontend`)
- The `...` suffix includes the package and all its dependencies

### 2. Cloudflare Pages Dashboard Settings

When configuring your Cloudflare Pages project in the dashboard:

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Root directory** | Leave empty | Uses the entire repository root |
| **Build command** | `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm --filter "./frontend/project-01..." run build:cf` | Same as wrangler.toml |
| **Build output directory** | `frontend/project-01/.open-next/assets` | Matches wrangler.toml |

## Workspace Configuration

The `frontend/project-01` package is included in the pnpm workspace via `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
packages:
  - 'frontend/*'
  # ... other packages
```

This enables pnpm to use path-based filtering to locate and build the frontend project.

## Why Path-Based Filtering?

Previously, the build command used `cd frontend/project-01 && pnpm build:cf`. While this works, the new approach using pnpm filters has several advantages:

1. **Name-independent**: Won't break if the package name changes (e.g., during rebranding from `autoecoops` to `machops`)
2. **Monorepo-aware**: pnpm can properly resolve workspace dependencies
3. **Consistent**: Same filter syntax works across different pnpm commands
4. **Explicit**: The `...` suffix makes it clear we want the package and its dependencies

## Build Process

When Cloudflare Pages triggers a build:

1. `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` installs all dependencies
2. `pnpm --filter "./frontend/project-01..."` selects the frontend package by path
3. `run build:cf` executes the `build:cf` script from `frontend/project-01/package.json`
4. The `build:cf` script runs: `npx @opennextjs/cloudflare@latest build`
5. OpenNext generates the Cloudflare-compatible output in `frontend/project-01/.open-next/assets`
6. Cloudflare Pages deploys the contents of this directory

## Troubleshooting

### "No projects matched the filters"

This error occurs when:
- The package is not in the pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- The filter path is incorrect
- Dependencies haven't been installed yet

**Solution**: Ensure `frontend/*` is listed in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and the filter path matches the actual directory structure.

### "Output directory not found"

This error occurs when:
- `pages_build_output_dir` doesn't match the actual OpenNext output location
- The build command failed before generating output
- The path is relative instead of from the repository root

**Solution**: Both `wrangler.toml` and Cloudflare Pages dashboard must point to `frontend/project-01/.open-next/assets` (relative to repository root).

### Build command differences between wrangler.toml and dashboard

If the dashboard settings differ from `wrangler.toml`, Cloudflare Pages may use the dashboard settings. To avoid confusion:

- Keep both configurations synchronized
- Use the same path-based filter command in both places
- Verify the output directory matches exactly
