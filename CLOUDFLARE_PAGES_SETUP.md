# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Setup

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `frontend/project-01/package.json`

The `build:cf` command has been updated to:
```json
"build:cf": "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://yrfxijooswpvdpdseswy.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_rhTyBa4IqqV14nV_B87S7g_zKzDSYTd npx @opennextjs/cloudflare@latest build && mv .open-next/worker.js .open-next/_worker.js && cp -r .open-next/assets/* .open-next/ 2>/dev/null || true && node -e 'require(\"fs\").writeFileSync(\".open-next/_routes.json\", JSON.stringify({version:1,include:[\"/*\"],exclude:[\"/_next/static/*\",\"/favicon.ico\",\"/robots.txt\",\"/sitemap.xml\",\"/feed.xml\",\"/404.html\",\"/BUILD_ID\",\"/search.json\",\"/tags/*\"]},null,2))'"
```

> **Note:** This is a long command that could be refactored into a separate script file for better maintainability. However, it's kept inline as requested to ensure compatibility with Cloudflare Pages direct GitHub deployment.

**What this does:**
- Uses `@opennextjs/cloudflare@latest` for the most up-to-date adapter
- Keeps Supabase environment variables
- **Post-processing steps:**
  1. Renames `worker.js` to `_worker.js` (required by Cloudflare Pages)
  2. Copies assets from `.open-next/assets/*` to `.open-next/` root
  3. Generates `_routes.json` with proper routing rules to avoid 404s

### 2. Renamed `wrangler.toml` to `wrangler.toml.bak`

This prevents Cloudflare Pages from showing warnings about the wrangler.toml file. The file is now renamed but kept for reference if needed.

## Required Cloudflare Pages Settings

Go to your Cloudflare Pages project:
**Pages → [Your Project] → Settings → Build & deployments → Build configuration**

### Settings to Update:

1. **Framework preset:**
   - Select: `Next.js (Static HTML Export)` or `None`

2. **Build command:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build:cf --filter=./frontend/project-01...
   ```
   
   Alternative if above doesn't work:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/project-01 && pnpm run build:cf
   ```

3. **Build output directory:**
   ```
   frontend/project-01/.open-next
   ```

4. **Root directory (Project root path):**
   ```
   /
   ```
   Keep this as root, not `frontend/project-01`

5. **Environment variables (if not already set):**
   These are already in the build command as inline environment variables.
   
   **Note:** The Supabase keys shown are public anonymous keys (indicated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_` and `sb_publishable_` prefixes) that are meant to be exposed in client-side code. For better security practices in production, consider setting these as Cloudflare Pages environment variables instead of inline in the build command.
   
   If you want to move them to Cloudflare Pages environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: `https://yrfxijooswpvdpdseswy.supabase.co`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: `sb_publishable_rhTyBa4IqqV14nV_B87S7g_zKzDSYTd`
   
   Then update the build:cf command to remove the inline variables.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Merge this PR to your main branch
2. Go to Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Build & deployments
3. Update the settings as shown above
4. Click **Save** on the settings page
5. Go to **Deployments** tab
6. Click **Retry deployment** on the latest deployment
7. Wait for the build to complete
8. Your site should now deploy successfully with all files!

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:

1. **Check build logs** in Cloudflare Pages to see if the build:cf command runs successfully
2. **Verify pnpm is available** - Cloudflare Pages should auto-detect it from `pnpm-lock.yaml`
3. **Check output directory** - After build, the `.open-next` folder should contain:
   - `_worker.js` (not `worker.js`)
   - `_routes.json`
   - All static assets
   - Other Next.js build files

### Expected file structure after build:

```
frontend/project-01/.open-next/
├── _worker.js          (Cloudflare Worker entry point)
├── _routes.json        (Routing configuration)
├── _next/              (Next.js static files)
├── cache/
└── [other build files]
```

The previous issue (only 52 files uploaded) was likely because:
- `worker.js` wasn't renamed to `_worker.js` (Cloudflare Pages requirement)
- Assets weren't copied to the correct location
- `_routes.json` was missing, causing routing issues
